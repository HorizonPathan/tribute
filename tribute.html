            She was born in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia).
            After living in Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India.
            She lived for most of her life.
            In 1950, Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity.
            A Roman Catholic religious congregation that had over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 countries as of 2012.
            The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis.
            It also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics,
            children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools.
             Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience,
             and also profess a fourth vow to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."
